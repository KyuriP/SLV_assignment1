To-dos
----
- Elaborate the questions better once we have finalized content.

- Describe summary table again (as per the changes).

- Clean up the region difference histogram + conclusion

- Clean up the missingness price plot + conclusion (think of a good transition to EP's imputation model..)

- Make a coherent theme (coloring, lables, etc.) for all the plots throughout the document (Think of the ink-to-data ratio & being color-blind friendly)

- map plots: fix the legend, colors. see if there is a better/efficient way to plot them

- In final stage: annotate all the code neatly, front-page with toc, name chunks.

- Check if both html & pdf renders nicely.

Points to discuss
---
- convert location, energy_class, n_rooms, n_bathrooms also to factor. (Do we all agree?) --> see if all relevant summary statistics are included.

- Gerko tips: plot distributions of price per region
