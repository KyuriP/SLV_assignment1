- Elaborate the questions better once we have finalized content.

- Describe summary table again (as per the changes).

- Clean up the region difference histogram + conclusion

- Clean up the missingness price plot + conclusion (think of a good transition to EP's imputation model..)
    - put all the bar plot in a plot (sharing the x and y-axis)
    -
    
- Make a coherent theme (coloring, lables, etc.) for all the plots throughout the document (Think of the ink-to-data ratio & being color-blind friendly)

- map plots: fix the legend, colors. see if there is a better/efficient way to plot them.
    - 3rd map plot of missing price: change the color of the legend
    -
- In final stage: annotate all the code neatly, front-page with toc, name chunks.

- Check if both html & pdf renders nicely.

Points to discuss
---
- convert location, energy_class, n_rooms, n_bathrooms also to factor. (Do we all agree?) --> see if all relevant summary statistics are included.

- Gerko tips: plot distributions of price per region, use diverse types of plots.

- @ ALL: Check cross-referencing works both in pdf and html !! (Fix it if not) --> simplest choice would be just write the literal number down when we have the final structure. (I did this for now).

- @ ALL: Let's make it concise... too extensive and somewhat repetitive description.

- @Daniel: 5.1) Can the data prep for geographical plotting more concise? And could you annotate the code for that chunk?

- @ALL: Actually describe the summary table.. anything stands out? mean? median? sd?.. 

- @ALL: Someone make sure the layout of pdf is good. (for each page)

- @ALL: color-blind friendly. hasn't check this yet.

- 5.2 map plot:  when we know which region we want to mention in the description, can we add the label for only those regions? 

- 5.2 : refine description. Discuss Median for each level, then discuss Mad....

- 5.3 : facet_wrap plot, add the median line to the legend + add description

- 5.3 : figure 6 bar plot: can we change the color for the top 3 high values? + description for the bar plot
- Figure caption in general: needs to be refined.

- each question (section) conlcusion
